# <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Structuring a research project </span>

The seven sections of a research paper are the following: Introduction, Background, Literature review , Methods, Results, and Discussion and Conclusion.

## Introduction

Motivation

- What is the problem
- Why is it important to solve?
- What is the scale of the problem

Include a short summary of the approach you take to solve the problem

## Background

Clinical context - bit more on the medical problem

Important technical concepts

- Eg:-
  - CNN - what is it, how does it work and why is it a good choice
  - ResNet
  - Dataset

## Literature Review

- Summarise the problem
- Discuss advantages & disadvantages of previous approaches to solve the problem
- What are the research gaps from the literature?

## Methods : (with justification)

## Explain and justify your method in detail.

- Dataset -
  - summarise your dataset
    - show example images of this analysis
  - Explanation of your method
    - Flow chart

## Results

Focus on being results driven. Try to figure out the minimum doable experiment that you can and then discuss and expand on it. Getting results as early as possible so you can expand on them is important.

## Show your results -

- Table of results of above metrics : Train/Validate/Test
- Confusion matrix
- Accuray or Loss as a function of epoch

## Discussion

- Explain your tables & figures in this results section, discussing what they show
  - Eg:-
    - A graph with a greater difference (between testing and validation in this case) is useful to show the result of overfitting.
- Explain what the key results are in the literature and compare your results against this.

## Conclusion

Summarise key findings :-

- What you did
- What you found
